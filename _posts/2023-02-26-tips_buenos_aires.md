Traveling to Buenos Aires for 33 days was a unique experience in my life, but it was also a bit challenging to plan. However, with proper planning and organization, I managed to make this trip a reality. If you're thinking of going to Buenos Aires, here's a step-by-step guide to help you (even if it's a shorter trip).

Here are some tips including buying plane tickets, booking on Airbnb, sending money, things to do/visit, and other useful tips.

### Step 1: Decide on your budget

Before booking anything, it's important to decide on your budget. It may seem obvious, but when I created a spreadsheet and started putting in expected expenses, I got a real sense of how much I would spend. Determine how much money you can spend on airfare, accommodation, food, transportation, activities, and souvenirs (this part can surprise you).

### Step 2: Buy plane tickets


After having an idea of your budget, it's time to start looking for plane tickets. You can search for flights on sites like [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights), [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/), or [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/). Compare prices, schedules, and airlines to find the best option for you. I bought round-trip tickets (Guarulhos GRU - Aeroparque AEP) with Aerolíneas Argentinas for approximately R$1400 in 8 installments.

The city has two airports, [Aeroparque Jorge Newbery](https://aeroparquebuenosaires.ar/) and [Buenos Aires Ezeiza Airport](https://aeropuertoezeiza.net/). My analogy is that they function like Congonhas and Guarulhos; Aeroparque is smaller and closer to the city, while Ezeiza is larger and farther from the city.

### Step 3: Book your accommodation


After buying your plane tickets, it's time to book your accommodation. Airbnb is a great option for budget-conscious travelers who want to experience the local culture. You can find affordable and comfortable accommodations in various neighborhoods of the city. Popular neighborhoods include Palermo, San Telmo, Recoleta, and Puerto Madero.

When booking on Airbnb, I made sure to read the space reviews, check the host and guest ratings, and see if the area had nearby amenities (subway, pharmacy, supermarket, restaurants). This is very important for a long stay.

I ended up choosing an apartment near [Abasto Shopping](https://www.abasto-shopping.com.ar/) on Avenida Corrientes. I chose this Airbnb because it met my needs well based on the factors mentioned above, and it was one block from the [Pueyrredón station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueyrred%C3%B3n_station_(Line_B)). It's a well-positioned station in relation to the rest of the city's metro points.

### Step 4: Send money


If you're traveling to Buenos Aires, you'll have to get used to using that ancient thing called physical money. This is because credit card exchange rates are not very friendly. There are several ways to send money; the method I used was via Western Union, withdrawing from locations that allow it.

My considerations for sending money:

- Will it be the weekend and you didn't buy pesos beforehand? Bring dollars.
  The US dollar is widely accepted, and many establishments offer parallel exchange rates. Many places work with a conversion of 1 USD = 300 pesos, which is better than using a credit card.

- Don't send too much money at once.
  The Western Union system is subject to failures. There may be mistakes, or someone might withdraw your money, or the location where you plan to withdraw might run out of money. To minimize losses or wasted trips for withdrawals, it's better to send smaller amounts of money each time and make more withdrawals.

I made transfers of R$250, which gave me approximately 15000 pesos each time, and I had no problems withdrawing the money. The process is simple: you make the transfer via Western Union, wait for the withdrawal to become available, go to the location, and withdraw with your passport. This video explains the step-by-step process in detail.

### Step 5: Plan your itinerary (but not too much)


Once your airfare, accommodation, and finances are settled, it's time to plan your itinerary. Buenos Aires offers a variety of activities and attractions for all tastes. Popular activities include exploring the city's historic neighborhoods, enjoying live music and dance performances, trying traditional Argentine cuisine, and taking day trips to nearby cities and attractions. However, over-planning can make you miss out on the surprise and connection with the city, so be open to exploring without prior knowledge.

### Step 6: Learn some Spanish


Although many people in Buenos Aires speak English, it's always helpful to learn some basic Spanish phrases. This will not only facilitate communication with locals but also enhance your cultural experience.

### Step 7: Get travel insurance


Finally, it's essential to get travel insurance to protect yourself in case of unforeseen events, such as flight cancellations or medical emergencies. Be sure to research different travel insurance providers and select a policy that meets your needs and budget.

### Step 8: Hola, Buenos Aires y ahora?

Ok, the plane has landed, everyone disembarks, now what?

There's no mystery. Due to the Brazil-Mercosur agreement, you can travel to Argentina with your ID (I took my passport hoping to get its first stamp, but the process was all digital, so it didn't help much hahaha). The immigration process was quite simple. They asked where I would stay (I showed the Airbnb reservation receipt), what I was going to do (tourism and eat a lot), and that was it. I took EVERYTHING printed: vaccination receipts, reservation proof, return trip proof. They didn't ask for it, but it's better to be safe.

After picking up my checked luggage, I used the airport's Wi-Fi to call an Uber to my reserved Airbnb since I didn't have a local SIM card yet.

Upon arrival, I found out that the nearby Western Union offices wouldn't open until Monday (I arrived on Saturday afternoon) and that the Claro store in Abasto Shopping only accepted cash for SIM cards for foreigners.

In summary, I spent the weekend buying food at the shopping mall and exploring the city on foot using the downloaded city map from Google Maps.

### Step 9: Discovering and experiencing the city


The city's subway and bus lines are well connected (compared to São Paulo, for example). I remember once taking a bus at 2 am from Palermo to Avenida Corrientes with no issues.

To take buses and the subway, you need to buy a subte card, usually sold at subway stations. It costs less than 2 reais, and you can top it up as you use it. During my stay, the subway fare was less than 1 real, and the bus fare was less than 50 cents for the places I needed to go (bus fare is proportional to your distance, you tell the driver where you're going, and the fare is based on your current distance to the destination; I really liked this system).

In general, it's easier to get a taxi than an Uber, and it's cheaper; just be cautious about fake bills and routes.

Now that you’ve organized your trip and accommodation, it’s time to plan your itinerary. Here are some things I did in Buenos Aires during these 30 days:

- Take a stroll through the charming neighborhood of San Telmo and explore its antique markets. On Sundays, you can visit the famous San Telmo fair. (In the market, I had one of the best barbecues of my life);
- Visit Plaza de Mayo and see the famous Casa Rosada, the presidential palace;
- Visit the famous Recoleta Cemetery, where Eva Perón is buried, the El Recoleta Cultural Center (there are always free programs, but some exhibitions are paid), and Floralis Genérica;
- Try Argentine food, such as empanadas, asado (barbecue), miga sandwiches, sweets, and also take the opportunity to try Peruvian and Mexican cuisine, which are very popular in the city;
- Watch a football match at La Bombonera, home of the famous Boca Juniors team. (I only visited the stadium, as I went during the 2022 World Cup, and there were no games happening);
- Walk along the colorful and lively Caminito street in La Boca, with many bars nearby, and the Bombonera stadium is very close;
- Explore the modern neighborhood of Puerto Madero and its modern architecture;
- Take a day trip to Tigre, a charming town located in the Paraná River delta;
- Visit the Feria de Mataderos, a traditional market where you can buy handicrafts and taste regional food;
- Explore the historic neighborhood of Monserrat and its many churches;
- Visit the Botanical Garden;
- Explore the Palermo neighborhood and its many bars and restaurants. I really liked La Fábrica de Tacos; after eating there, eating tacos anywhere else became a sadness. I ate at Las Petunias and also had a great dining experience there;
- Visit El Ateneo Grand Splendid, a famous bookstore located in a historic theater;
- Visit the Evita Museum and learn about her life;
- On Monday, go to the La Bomba del Tiempo show at the Konex Cultural Center. You can buy tickets at the box office, which will be cheaper. It's really unmissable;
- Enjoy a lot of gelato; they are well-priced and delicious.

In conclusion, planning a 30-day trip to Buenos Aires can be a daunting task, but with careful planning and organization, it can be an unforgettable adventure. Remember to budget wisely, book your airfare and accommodation in advance, send money if necessary, plan your itinerary, learn some Spanish, and get travel insurance. With these tips, you'll be well on your way to enjoying everything Buenos Aires has to offer.
