##### Makeover Monday is a project in the form of a dashboard that is published by one of the participants and must be redone by anyone who wishes. The dataset example is published weekly on the website.

#### The theme for week 3 is: Is it time to treat sugar like smoking?

##### The average teenager consumes three times more sugar than recommended, as a percentage of total calories. There are worldwide efforts by governments using different methods, such as introducing new taxes, advertisements, and new public policies to combat consumption.

##### In Brazil, there is regulation of school canteens in public schools. The National School Feeding Program (PNAE) is regulated by Law No. 11.947 of June 16, 2009, and serves students enrolled in basic education in the public school network. This is part of actions to combat overweight and obesity, contained in the National Food and Nutritional Security Plans, the Chronic Non-Communicable Disease Plan, and the Intersectoral Obesity Combat Plan.

## Points I wanted to show:
- Comparison over time
- Use of age groups
- Adding the parameter line for consumption (5%)
