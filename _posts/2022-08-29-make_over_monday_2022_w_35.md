Makeover Monday is a weekly project where participants can recreate a visualization.

Good practices:

- Green color which is very much attached to the military aspect
- Use of flags to represent countries

## My version

#### How did I develop it?
I used Power BI to create my version of the visualization. Power BI is a tool I am very comfortable with, and it provides a lot of flexibility for creating detailed and interactive visualizations. Here are the steps I followed:

1. **Data Import**: I imported the dataset provided for this Makeover Monday challenge into Tableau.
2. **Data Cleaning**: I checked for any inconsistencies or missing values in the dataset and cleaned the data as needed.
3. **Data Transformation**: I transformed the data to make it suitable for visualization. This included creating new calculated columns and measures to better represent the data.
4. **Visualization Creation**: I created a bar chart to show the top 10 countries in military spending. I used green colors to align with the military theme and added country flags for better visual identification.
5. **Final Touches**: I added titles, labels, and tooltips to make the visualization more informative and user-friendly.

## Result

## What I would like to show
- The comparison of military spending among the top 10 countries.
- The use of country flags for better visual identification.
- The clear and straightforward representation of data using a chart.
