2020 turned into a blur of weekend hackathons and wome weekends i built, others i mentored, and occasionally i helped facilitate. showing up for other people’s projects sharpened my own: my questions got better, my triage got faster, and my feedback got calmer.

events where i was a mentor:

- [nasa - space apps challenge 2020](https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/awards/global-nominees)
- [un and sebrae - social hack 2020](https://www.sympla.com.br/social-hack---hackeando-os-objetivos-globais-da-onu__661769)
- [ufscar - innovation and entrepreneurship challenge - 2020](https://www.facebook.com/desafioufscar/)
- [polinize hackathon 2020](https://hackathon.polinize.com/)
- [hacka das manas 2021](https://www.hackathondasmanas.com/)

### 1. mentoring is a two-way street

mentoring isn’t a broadcast. i arrive to help and leave with a notebook of things i learned—new tools to try, sharper prompts, and patterns you only spot when multiples teams attack the same brief. the trade is fair: i bring perspective and structure and teams give me angles i wouldn’t have found alone.


### 2. listening is key

hearing isn’t the same as listening. my small checklist is: restate what i heard, ask one clarifying question, then offer a suggestion. that rhythm avoids “mentor karaoke,” where advice gets projected onto a problem that isn’t there. when a team feels understood, the next steps become obvious, docs get clearer, and the prototype makes sense to people who weren’t in the room.

### 3. avoid the dungeon master syndrome

![](https://i.imgur.com/tcgdHjD.jpg)

jargon can feel like armor. i’ve reached for dense language or elaborate frameworks when a plain sentence would do. real expertise should make things simpler for other people, not heavier. as [james clear](https://jamesclear.com/) has argued elsewhere: 

```
“simplifying before understanding the details is ignorance.
simplifying after understanding the details is genius.”
```

moreover, being present is important to follow the team's development.

### 4. sometimes the team just needs a hint

plenty of blockers are navigational, not deep. a pointer to a starter repo, the right api doc, or a better search query can unlock an hour of progress. as an ambassador for some hackathons i collected a small repo of recurring links and prompts/practical breadcrumbs people asked for when the clock was loud. it’s not about handing out answers, but it’s about lowering the cost of the next step so momentum doesn’t die.
