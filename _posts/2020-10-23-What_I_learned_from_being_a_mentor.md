2020 turned into a blur of weekend hackathons and wome weekends I built, others I mentored, and occasionally I helped facilitate. Showing up for other people’s projects sharpened my own: my questions got better, my triage got faster, and my feedback got calmer.

Events where I was a mentor:

- [NASA - Space Apps Challenge 2020](https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/awards/global-nominees)
- [UN and Sebrae - Social Hack 2020](https://www.sympla.com.br/social-hack---hackeando-os-objetivos-globais-da-onu__661769)
- [UFSCar - Innovation and Entrepreneurship Challenge - 2020](https://www.facebook.com/desafioufscar/)
- [Polinize Hackathon 2020](https://hackathon.polinize.com/)
- [Hacka das Manas 2021](https://www.hackathondasmanas.com/)

### 1. mentoring is a two-way street

Mentoring isn’t a broadcast. I arrive to help and leave with a notebook of things I learned—new tools to try, sharper prompts, and patterns you only spot when multiples teams attack the same brief. The trade is fair: I bring perspective and structure and teams give me angles I wouldn’t have found alone.


### 2. listening is key

Hearing isn’t the same as listening. My small checklist is: restate what I heard, ask one clarifying question, then offer a suggestion. That rhythm avoids “mentor karaoke,” where advice gets projected onto a problem that isn’t there. When a team feels understood, the next steps become obvious, docs get clearer, and the prototype makes sense to people who weren’t in the room.

### 3. avoid the dungeon master syndrome

Jargon can feel like armor. I’ve reached for dense language or elaborate frameworks when a plain sentence would do. Real expertise should make things simpler for other people, not heavier. As [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) has argued elsewhere: 

```
“Simplifying before understanding the details is ignorance.
Simplifying after understanding the details is genius.”
```

Moreover, being present is important to follow the team's development.

### 4. sometimes the team just needs a hint

Plenty of blockers are navigational, not deep. A pointer to a starter repo, the right API doc, or a better search query can unlock an hour of progress. As an ambassador for some hackathons I collected a small repo of recurring links and prompts/practical breadcrumbs people asked for when the clock was loud. It’s not about handing out answers, but it’s about lowering the cost of the next step so momentum doesn’t die.
