## people to follow - business intelligence tools

tableau, qlik, and power bi are three of the most widely used analytics platforms. they show up year after year in gartner’s magic quadrant for analytics and business intelligence platforms and, more importantly, inside real companies doing real work. these tools let bi teams build reliable data models and clear visual stories that help people make better decisions.

learning them well takes time. following practitioners who share practical tips, mistakes, and examples can flatten the learning curve. the folks below publish tutorials, breakdowns of new features, and battle-tested advice you can use on your next dashboard or data model.

the list is in **alphabetical order** by name.
