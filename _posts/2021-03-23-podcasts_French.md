### In French

- [News in Slow French](https://www.newsinslowfrench.com/): News on topics such as world politics, economy, arts, and science with proficiency levels ranging from beginner to advanced.
- [Français Authentique](https://www.francaisauthentique.com/podcasts/): The host of the podcast is Johan, a native French speaker. He is very realistic. For example, in an episode called "Comment parler comme un français," he begins by telling listeners that they will never speak like a French person because they are not native speakers - but that's okay. It's nothing that isn't very obvious but relevant because this happens in any language, and there's no point in falling for the myth that you only speak well if you can speak like a native speaker.

### From English to French

- [Coffee Break French](https://coffeebreaklanguages.com/coffeebreakfrench/): The podcast already has four seasons to learn French from English.
- [Daily French Pod](https://dailyfrenchpod.com/): More than four thousand episodes teaching about everyday situations that can be encountered in France.
