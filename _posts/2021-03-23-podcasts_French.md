structured lessons presented in english with progressively more french. ideal for building grammar and phrases step by step. typical length: 15–20 minutes.

**daily french pod**

thousands of short episodes covering daily situations and culture. good for frequent, bite-size practice. typical length: 3–8 minutes.

## make these shows work for you

- shadow key phrases: pause and repeat out loud to practice pronunciation and rhythm.  
- build a mini‑glossary: note 5–10 new words per episode with short example sentences.  
- re‑listen strategically: first for gist, then for details, then for pronunciation.  
- use transcripts when available: read once, then listen without text to reinforce memory.  
- keep sessions short and regular: 10 ~~ 20 minutes beats occasional long sessions.
