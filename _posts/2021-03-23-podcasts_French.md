## English‑led programs

Structured lessons presented in English with progressively more French. Ideal for building grammar and phrases step by step. Typical length: 15–20 minutes.

**Daily French Pod**

Thousands of short episodes covering daily situations and culture. Good for frequent, bite-size practice. Typical length: 3–8 minutes.

## Make these shows work for you

- Shadow key phrases: pause and repeat out loud to practice pronunciation and rhythm.  
- Build a mini‑glossary: note 5–10 new words per episode with short example sentences.  
- Re‑listen strategically: first for gist, then for details, then for pronunciation.  
- Use transcripts when available: read once, then listen without text to reinforce memory.  
- Keep sessions short and regular: 10 ~~ 20 minutes beats occasional long sessions.
